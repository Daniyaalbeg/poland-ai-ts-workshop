        "Had another lesson with John. We looked at the Roy Orbison Song Crying. Voice improving, breathing getting stronger, needs to work on posture next. A little bit of anchoring would also do a world of good.",
        "Had another lesson with John. His posture is improving. Stomach's still a little bit tight."

        "Phil is a 25-year-old bricklayer who wants to learn to sing as a hobby. He's really into Counting Crows. His top note is currently E-flat. We focused on breathing and the usual first lesson stuff. Next time I want to focus a little bit more on twang.",
        "He also really wants to be a part of the concert at the end of the year, so I need to make sure I save a slot for him."
