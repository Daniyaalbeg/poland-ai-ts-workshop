        "mezzo-soprano",
        "Had another lesson with Kirsty. We looked at some popular stuff like \"Landslide\" by Fleetwood Mac. We're doing \"Hallelujah\". We looked at breathing and some twang.",
        "Suggested song: \"Send in the Clowns\" by Stephen Sondheim. It's a well-known song often suggested for mezzo-sopranos. It has a musical theatre feel, which might appeal to someone who likes the drama and emotion in \"Hallelujah\" and the storytelling aspect of \"Landslide\"",
        "Suggested songs: \"As Long As He Needs Me\" from Oliver! and \"Belle\" from Beauty and the Beast."

        "Had another lesson with John. We looked at the Roy Orbison Song Crying. Voice improving, breathing getting stronger, needs to work on posture next. A little bit of anchoring would also do a world of good.",
        "Had another lesson with John. His posture is improving. Stomach's still a little bit tight."
