Now we understand how tools work, we can investigate how to integrate MCP into our setup.

If we only use MCP's most basic features, we can think of it as a USB port for plugging in tools into our application.

MCP servers can be run locally, and then connected to via a standard I/O connection.

Alternatively, we can connect to a remote HTTP server running an MCP server.

In this exercise, we're going to use a local MCP server running in a Docker container.

We're going to use the GitHub MCP server, which is a server that can be used to interact with the GitHub API.

To run the GitHub MCP server, we need to have a GitHub personal access token.
