Add an ESLint config which errors with unused imports.

---

Re-check all exercise frontends for potential spacing issues.

---

Remove any `.gitignore` files and change `data` to `gitignore-me`. `data` is too general and means that I need to add.gitignore files into each directory where it's used which is ugly.

---

Check that the CLI, when you're selecting which directory to run the exercise in, only gives you directories as options.

---

Make the CLI listen for `n` to go to the next exercise, `p` to go to the previous exercise, and `enter` to ask for a list of exercises.

---

Review all exercise texts to see what reference material I need to add. Last complete section: 01

---

Reorder all reference material and link it to the exercises.

---

Look at the `body` of the `useChat` hook issue in `10.1`.

---

Add a link checker that checks all links that start with `/` in the material.

---

Make `pnpm dev` run the exercise CLI.
