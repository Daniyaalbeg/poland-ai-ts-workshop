Make sure each exercise has a suggestion in the text box for what the user can send to the LLM.

---

Add an ESLint config which errors with unused imports.

---

Re-check all exercise frontends for potential spacing issues.

---

Look at the MCP/SSE exercise and debug why it's hanging indefinitely.

---

Connect the reference material to the exercises.

---

Remove any `.gitignore` files and change `data` to `gitignore-me`. Data is too general and means that I need to add.gitignore files into each directory where it's used which is ugly.

---

Check that the CLI, when you're selecting which directory to run the exercise in, only gives you directories as options.

---

Make the CLI listen for `n` to go to the next exercise, `p` to go to the previous exercise, and `enter` to ask for a list of exercises.

---

Rename each exercise folder to use 07.1, 07.2, etc.
